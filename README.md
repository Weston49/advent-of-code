# advent-of-code
All of my personal advent of code solutions and attempts. As of writing this, all serious attempts have been in c++. This repo is specifically setup so working these problems in c++ is as easy as possible.

## Usage - (notes for my future self)
When starting a new day, cd into the year you wish to work on and run `sh ./setup/newday [day number]` to create a folder and starter files for that day. Use the `example.txt` to either paste in or create your own example inputs. Then you can use `input.txt` for your full puzzle input. To try out your code, run `make` in the folder for the day you are working on, then `./bin < input.txt` and your code from `main.cpp` should run with `input.txt` on stdin.

Ignore all of this for 2024 cause doing python woo :)
